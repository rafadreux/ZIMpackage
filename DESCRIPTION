Description: This package allows the use of the classification models obtained in the research paper (Fernandes et al., 2017) published in Computers and Electronics in Agriculture (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2017.09.005). These models allow the authomatic classification of leaf-patch-clamp-pressure probes output variable (Pp) daily curves into states 1 (low stress), 2 (moderate stress) and 3 (highly stressed) which was described by previous literature.
